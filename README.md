This is an extension added to slicer software. The purpose of this extension is to plot line intensity profiles of a drawn line in 2
given 3D images. The working procedure of the extension is described below

1. Input 2 seperate 3D data using the below stated inputs

         a. First Volume
         b. Second Volume

2. Choose the ruler , and draw a line connecting 2 points

3. Click 'APPLY' button

The functionality of the extension is described below

1. This extension reads the intensity values of the points of the image which lies on the line drawn by the user.

2. Intensity values are read from both the images

3. A plot is created to comapre the intensity variations between two input images with respect to the common line drawn by the user.

Note:- The results of this extension can be understood more through the images given in this repository
